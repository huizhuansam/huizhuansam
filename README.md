# Welcome to Hui Zhuan's GitHub profile!

## About me ü§†
You can call me Hui Zhuan (pronounced h-wei zh-wan). I also go by my handle @huizhuansam on social media.

## What I do ‚öôÔ∏è
I'm a recent graduate from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/)'s Bachelor of Computing (Honours) Computer Science programme. I love to put software together with different technologies, be it CLI tools or web apps, and figuring out what works well and what doesn't in the process.

Currently seeking employment in a software engineering role in Singapore. Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hui-zhuan-siew/) for a chat!
